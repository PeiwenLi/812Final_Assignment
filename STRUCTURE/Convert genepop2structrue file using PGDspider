Use PGDSpider to convert Structure input file to Arelquin file
	Pyrad does not make Arlequin files

1.	Log in to HPCVL (if not already)
cd to your working directory (e.g, u1/work/hpc3484)
2.	ls (make sure the file you want to convert is there, and that a dummy output file is also there)
3.	Use the following script to get and unzip PGDSpider in your working directory 

wget http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/PGDSpider/PGDSpider_2.1.0.2.zip
unzip PGDSpider_2.1.0.2.zip -d ./pgdspider/

Once you’ve retrieved and unzipped PGDSPider, you only need to use the following:

cd pgdspider/PGDSpider_2.1.0.2/

chmod u+x PGDSpider2.sh (only need to do this once as well)

./PGDSpider2.sh
the .jar is another way to trigger PGDSpider. The .jar and .sh have the same function. So also can use the following command to trigger:
java -jar PGDSpider2.jar

A GUI will appear! (eventually…)
The bash is not able to show a GUI. To do so, you will have to use –X command when you login. The –X helps to bring GUI. 

Choose files and settings in PGDSpider:

Under Data Input File, choose File format - Structure 
Choose file (i.e. the file you created from Pyrad or the example file)

Under Data Output File, choose File format - Arlequin 
Choose dummy output file you created

Create and/or edit .spid file (change something inside, for example, type of the data to SNP, and -9 in missing value code, and 9798 in number of markers listed in the input). Then save and apply, and hit convert

Hit ‘convert’
You may see some error when converting, just change the default
